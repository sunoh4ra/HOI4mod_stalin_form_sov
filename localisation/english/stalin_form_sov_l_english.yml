  stalin_form_sov.1.desc: "During Zinoviev's preparations to merge the Bolshevik Party into the VST, some core party leaders began to strongly oppose this plan. Sverdlov realized that Zinoviev's ambitions would not only weaken the independence of the Bolshevik Party but also inflict irreparable damage to the party's unity.\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph Stalin, once one of the party's most powerful leaders, was clearly unwilling to let Zinoviev's political maneuvers completely overshadow the Bolsheviks. Although Stalin's position within the party had significantly diminished, his close ties with the military began to provide him with increasingly powerful support. Since the Bolsheviks took power, Stalin had always played a key role in the military. Despite the army's dissolution after the failure of the First Russian Revolution and Stalin's subsequent exile abroad, he returned swiftly after the success of the Second Revolution, quickly re-entering the military's high command and demonstrating his formidable control. In fact, Russia's military is now largely led by exiled Bolshevik commanders, so despite the ongoing power struggles within the party, Stalin's influence within the military has never waned, providing him with a crucial political base.\n\nAs Stalin extended an olive branch to Sverdlov during a private meeting, the two formed a secret alliance within the party, and discussions on how to thwart Zinoviev's plans may already be on the agenda..."

  stalin_form_sov.2.desc: "Amid the fierce debate within the Bolshevik Party over whether to merge with the VST, Zinoviev began to feel increasing pressure from within the party. He learned that Sverdlov and Stalin, two former revolutionary comrades, were conspiring to overthrow his merger plan.\n\nRecently, Sverdlov sent an invitation through private channels, requesting Zinoviev to attend an important meeting at Stalin's residence. The details of the meeting were not clearly disclosed, but Zinoviev knew that this was likely a crucial conversation about the party's future direction. Should he accept the invitation, meet with them, and engage in dialogue, or refuse and continue with his own plans? Zinoviev's decision would directly impact the political landscape of the Bolshevik Party, the VST, and the future of Russia. He was also well aware that discontent within the party had been growing, and this meeting might be his last chance to engage with the opposition led by Stalin. If communication succeeded, it would greatly advance his merger plan. Of course, he could also refuse, and, given his current position, openly call for a 'democratic' discussion within the party, confident that no one would oppose this."

  stalin_form_sov.3.t: "Meeting Begins"
  stalin_form_sov.3.desc: "Zinoviev ultimately accepted Sverdlov's invitation and arrived at Stalin's residence. An indescribable tension filled the air. According to Sverdlov, this meeting was meant to reach a consensus on the future direction of the Bolshevik Party, but they all knew deep down that this was not a simple political debate — it was a power struggle concerning the political fate of both the VST and the Bolshevik Party.\n\nWhen Zinoviev pushed open the door, Sverdlov and Stalin were already seated. To his surprise, most of the high-ranking Bolshevik officials and even Communist faction members from the VST were present. The two men appeared outwardly calm, but to Zinoviev, their gazes were filled with an almost indecipherable pressure. Sverdlov's expression was unusually stern; although he still maintained his mild exterior, Zinoviev could sense that his former revolutionary comrade now harbored hostility toward him. Stalin, despite having lost his former illustrious position, still commanded significant influence in the military. Though his voice was no longer as strident, the innate authority he wielded made him impossible to dismiss.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Sverdlov stated directly that the plan to merge the Bolshevik Party into the VST would not only weaken party unity but might also trigger large-scale social unrest. Sverdlov believed that the party's independence was key to the revolution's success, and merging with the VST would cause the Bolshevik Party to lose its leading position among the working class, thereby undermining the revolution's foundation. Stalin was even more vehement, arguing that Zinoviev's plan was not just a threat to the party's independence but a betrayal of the revolution itself. He emphasized that if this plan continued, the Bolshevik Party would fall into an even deeper split, potentially sacrificing the fruits of the revolution. Stalin could not contain his anger, harshly criticizing Zinoviev's 'political adventurism,' even alluding to his historical failures, suggesting that this 'merger' could be a politically irreversible self-destruction.\n\nZinoviev tried to remain calm, knowing he had to give his all in this debate. Facing strong opposition from Sverdlov and Stalin, he attempted to explain his plan, emphasizing the significance of party unity to the revolution, and firmly believing that integration with the VST was an inevitable trend in revolutionary development. However, as the argument intensified, Zinoviev gradually realized that he was not gaining the upper hand."
  stalin_form_sov.3.a: "The meeting continues..."

  stalin_form_sov.4.t: "Consensus Cannot Be Reached"
  stalin_form_sov.4.desc: "The situation grew increasingly tense. Sverdlov's words gradually turned into threats, warning that if Zinoviev insisted on his position, he would face mounting opposition within the party. Stalin watched him coldly, expressionless, as if prepared for the worst. Suddenly, Stalin pulled out a document from under the table labeled \"Emergency Measures\" and calmly stated, \"If you cannot understand what kind of leadership the Bolshevik Party needs in the future, then you are no longer suitable to be the party's highest leader.\" Zinoviev's heart skipped a beat; he knew he had reached a decisive moment.\n\nAt that point, Stalin slowly stood up, approached Zinoviev, and with a cool tone tinged with danger, said, \"I don’t want to end our conversation this way, comrade, but if you refuse to accept reality, then I will have no choice.\" The meeting room door was quietly closed, and Sverdlov exchanged a glance with Stalin. Without a word, Stalin ordered the military outside to quickly enter and take control of Zinoviev. Zinoviev finally realized this meeting had been premeditated, and that the future of the revolution likely no longer belonged to him. He did not react violently; he simply sighed resignedly and accepted it all.\n\nAfterward, Sverdlov and Stalin convened an emergency meeting on the spot. Given that the VST under Zinoviev's control had already crushed factions with differing opinions, the Communist faction members from the Labor Union who attended had enough influence, especially since most of the military was now effectively controlled by former Bolshevik commanders. They decided to change the leadership of the VST immediately. Under the watchful eyes of Stalin's dispatched guards, the meeting passed a resolution for Zinoviev to resign as chairman of the VST.\n\nMeanwhile, Stalin recognized that without Zinoviev, the VST would become leaderless. He declared that the opportunity had come for the Bolshevik Party to once again lead the Russian socialist revolution. He immediately proposed reorganizing new government institutions, led by the Bolshevik Party, to better face the challenges the revolution would soon confront. His proposal not only gained the support of most people in the party but was also endorsed by the Communist faction members from the VST. It was clear that the fate of Socialist Russia was about to undergo a monumental shift from that day forward..."

  stalin_form_sov.5.t: "Reversing the October Revolution"
  stalin_form_sov.5.desc: "After a series of intense political struggles, Zinoviev's ultimate fall from power became inevitable, and the leadership of the VST was replaced by the Bolshevik Party, which was now entering a crucial period of power transition. Through the joint efforts of Sverdlov and Stalin, Zinoviev was forced to resign as chairman of the VST and was placed under house arrest. With the situation under control, a special meeting was convened within the party to decide who would become the new leader of the Bolshevik Party to steer the Russian revolution. At this meeting, Sverdlov and Stalin engaged in their final contest. This was not just a power struggle between two leaders, but a battle between their respective ideals and the future direction of the revolution.\n\nSverdlov firmly believed that the strength of the Bolshevik Party should come from collective leadership and democratic decision-making. He had always advocated for a broader collective leadership system within the party, believing that only through collective consensus, whether from various party factions or the working class, could the revolution advance. However, this stance also earned the dissatisfaction of some party members and military forces, particularly Stalin and his supporters, who believed that, in times of crisis, only strong leadership could ensure the revolution's victory.\n\nIn contrast, Stalin believed that the success of the revolution must rely on strong centralized authority. He argued for a concentrated leadership that could command the revolution decisively. In Stalin's view, the future of the Bolshevik Party required not only unity within the party but also a unified command structure and clear action guidelines, especially in the upcoming revolutionary war against German imperialism, where any division within the party could lead to disaster. Stalin, with his influence in the military, could quickly mobilize forces to crush Germany's ambitions.\n\nThis meeting would determine the future leadership model of the Bolshevik Party, and the direction of party support would ultimately decide who could lead the revolution to victory."

Initially set to become a priest, he became acquainted with Marxism in Tiflis and became a propagandist and strike organiser under the name 'Koba'.\n\nExiled to Siberia multiple times, he was freed in 1917 and became a key Bolshevik in Petrograd. During the Civil War, Stalin served as the People's Commissar for Nationalities and took on various military-political duties. Of particular importance was his conflict with Lev Trotsky over the usage of former Tsarist officers, which Stalin categorically opposed. After Lenin's death in August 1918, Stalin became one of the ruling Troika alongside Sverdlov and Trotsky and ultimately prevailed in his view aligned with 'Military Opposition'. This policy was later criticised as weakening the Red Army at a critical moment.\n\nStalin was strongly involved in the defence of Tsaritsyn together with Kliment Voroshilov, and the high point of his career would come in 1920 as he served briefly as the People's Commissar of Military Affairs.\n\nNow, Stalin, together with Sverdlov, has successfully thwarted Zinoviev's conspiracy to completely abolish the Bolshevik Party and merge it into the VST. In the subsequent party debate, he argued convincingly that the success of the revolution must rely on strong centralized authority, advocating for concentrated power led by a core leadership to command the revolution. Eventually, Stalin successfully persuaded most party members and returned to a leadership position.

Blindly copying our syndicalist friends' policies is likely impractical. According to Lenin's vision, we should establish a union of republics composed of various socialist countries in the near future. Perhaps the administrative status of these Union Republics should also follow this vision, reorganizing them as Soviet Socialist Republics.

The Preparatory Conference suggested that the Provisional Government immediately announce a radical 'Land and Peace' program, but this was rejected. The Military Revolutionary Committee promptly began operations from October 21, and at the special meeting of the Petrograd Soviet on the afternoon of the 25th, the Military Committee announced that the Provisional Government had been overthrown. The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets held that night marked the establishment of Soviet power and signaled the beginning of a new era for Russia. The monarchists, mainly former nobles and capitalists, began supporting Nicholas II's restoration, while liberals, though opposed to imperial restoration, temporarily united with various anti-Bolshevik forces to form the White Army in opposition to Soviet power, and the Russian Civil War erupted.\n\nBut the story did not end well.

The followers of Lenin are united once again.\n\nWith the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the VST and the All-Union Communist Party have entered a new revolutionary phase, and they will continue to work together sincerely for a better future for socialist Russia.§!\n"

The Soviet system has now taken root in the flesh and blood of workers, with all laborers participating. The VST has actually lost its original administrative role and can now only follow the steps of the Communist Party Central Committee, fulfilling its economic functions under the guidance of the National Economic Council. All this is carried out under the leadership of the proletariat's vanguard—the Bolshevik Party. Therefore, we should draft a new constitution based on the current situation and our vision for the future."

  stalin_form_sov.7.t: "Discussion on the Future of the Soviets"
  stalin_form_sov.7.desc: "As the smoke of war gradually dissipates, our scarred homeland welcomes a brief period of peace. Although the flames that once engulfed the European continent have been extinguished, the trauma they left behind remains deeply etched in every citizen's heart. The people look forward to a brighter future, yearning for stability, prosperity, and a just social order. Behind the high walls of the Kremlin, party leaders engage in fierce debate about the nation's path forward.\n\nSome leaders advocate for expanding party democracy, believing the Soviet system should return to its original ideals, allowing workers, peasants, and delegates at all levels to truly hold power, thereby ensuring more transparent and just national governance. They believe that only by giving grassroots more voice can the entire society's vitality be stimulated, enabling the Soviet Union to experience new revival from the post-war ruins.\n\nHowever, another faction scoffs at this idea, firmly believing that only by continuing to consolidate the existing leadership system can the country's stability and strength be assured. In their view, excessive dispersal of power will lead to internal division, while absolute unity within the party is the only guarantee for the Soviet Union to move forward. Facing hostility from the external capitalist world and the task of internal reconstruction, they advocate strengthening control over the state machinery to ensure the party's will is implemented without the slightest wavering.\n\nToday, the Soviets stand at a historical crossroads. Will its future move toward a more open internal party democracy, or continue along the path of high centralization? The outcome of this debate will determine the fate of the entire nation."

  stalin_form_sov.8.t: "Discussion on Reform"
  stalin_form_sov.8.desc: "In the conference hall of the Kremlin, Politburo members have launched a new round of heated discussions on the topic of reform. With attention from people across the country, this debate is no longer confined to the upper echelons but has spread to party organizations at all levels and local Soviets. The Soviet Union stands at a historical juncture, where every decision will affect the nation's destiny.\n\nReformists advocate expanding the power of workers' congresses and giving localities more autonomous decision-making space to improve governance efficiency and allow true people's representatives to participate in state management. They point out that during wartime, the centralized model certainly improved mobilization capabilities, but in peacetime, the governance model should be more flexible to avoid bureaucratic rigidity.\n\nHowever, conservatives warn that this loose governance model will severely weaken the central government's control, plunging the country into chaos. They emphasize the need to continue strengthening the party's leadership core to ensure highly unified decision-making in response to potential international challenges. They propose expanding the power of national security departments to monitor potential opposition as necessary to maintain national stability.\n\nAt this meeting, all eyes are on Stalin, whose attitude will determine the direction of reform."
  stalin_form_sov.8.a: "Reform should be limited and not undermine the party's leadership position."
  stalin_form_sov.8.b: "The People's Congress should have more power."

  stalin_form_sov.9.t: "Shaping the State Governance Model"
  stalin_form_sov.9.desc: "As reforms progress, discussions about the state governance model intensify across the country. From factory workers in Moscow to local officials in Kyiv, to military commanders in the Far East, everyone is watching the impending decisions from the Kremlin. This debate about the future of the Soviets exists not only in Politburo meeting rooms but also creates ripples in streets, workers' canteens, and military camp meetings.\n\nIn some regions, local Soviets have begun experimenting with new self-governance models, attempting to grant local governments more decision-making power without undermining national unity. Factory workers have organized representative committees to propose more direct labor policies; rural cooperatives seek more flexible production allocation rights within the planned economy framework. However, simultaneously, national security agencies have strengthened surveillance of dissidents. Any rhetoric promoting 'excessive liberalization' alerts the government, secret police activity has notably increased, and some local political dissidents have been 'temporarily detained' for ideological rectification.\n\nReformists emphasize that the Soviet Union's future cannot rely on a single power structure but should build a more transparent governance system allowing Soviets at all levels to truly reflect the people's voice. They advocate revising certain laws, expanding the power of workers' congresses, and encouraging academia, economic experts, and social organizations to participate in policy-making, bringing the government closer to people's needs.\n\nHowever, conservatives remain highly vigilant. They believe past successes were achieved through unified party leadership, and any measures weakening central authority could lead to national instability. To this end, they promote a series of new laws strengthening control over media, publications, and academic institutions to ensure ideological uniformity. Meanwhile, high-ranking military generals are pressuring the central government to maintain the existing power structure to prevent any political turmoil that might threaten Soviet security.\n\nThe entire country seems pulled in two different directions, with everyone awaiting the Kremlin's final decision. Will this reform lead to broader internal party democracy or further consolidate the existing leadership system? The answer is about to be revealed."

  stalin_form_sov.10.desc: "As discussions about the state governance model deepen, party leadership begins drafting a new Soviet constitution to establish the future political framework. The new constitution will determine not only the party's operational methods but also influence state administration, economic policies, and citizens' fundamental rights.\n\nAt the constitutional committee meetings, two distinctly different concepts clash head-on. Reformists want to give the constitution greater authority, ensuring Soviet congresses at all levels can make independent decisions and reducing party intervention in state institutions. Conservatives emphasize that the constitution must maintain the party's central position, ensure state machinery operation isn't weakened by local forces, and strengthen national security mechanisms to prevent potential division and instability.\n\nStalin himself has not publicly stated his position, instead letting the constitutional committee reach consensus on its own. The new constitution will lay the political foundation for the Soviet Union for decades to come, and this decision will affect the entire nation's fate."

This constitution will establish not only the state governance model but also determine the power relationship between party and state. In the Kremlin's meeting hall, the struggle between reformists and conservatives has reached a white-hot intensity, with the final decision shaping the Soviet Union's development direction for decades to come.\n\nThe new constitution establishes the party's absolute leadership position, emphasizing centralized power and ensuring efficient state machinery operation. All local Soviet decision-making power ultimately remains subject to the party's supreme directives, with national security agencies gaining greater authority to maintain state stability. Although this system ensures national unity and order, it also means further tightening of political freedom."

This constitution grants local Soviets greater power, ensuring workers' congresses have a genuine voice in decision-making processes. Media and academia gain more freedom, while state institutions' transparency is also improved. However, the stability of this new system remains questionable, with some party hardliners remaining vigilant."

  RUS_the_supreme_soviet_desc: "The core of the Soviet system lies in congresses at various levels, and the post-war situation requires us to further improve this system. The Supreme Soviet will serve as the highest legislative body, managing national affairs and ensuring the party's leadership position is implemented. Under the new system, the central government will have higher decision-making efficiency, while congresses at all levels will continue to play their role in state governance."
  RUS_supreme_soviet: "Supreme Soviet"
  RUS_supreme_soviet_desc: "As the highest legislative body of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet is not only the core institution of state governance but also largely reflects the country's political direction. It consists of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, theoretically representing the interests of workers, peasants, soldiers, and all union republics.\n\nIn the reformists' vision, the Supreme Soviet should become a true legislative body, granting congresses at various levels greater decision-making power, making the government more transparent, and reducing direct party intervention. They advocate establishing an independent constitutional court, giving laws higher authority to prevent excessive intervention by administrative bodies.\n\nHowever, in the conservatives' view, the Supreme Soviet's primary task is to maintain the party's leadership position and ensure national unity and stability. Although congresses convene regularly, final decisions must still follow party guidance, and any reforms that might lead to power dispersal must be contained. They propose passing a new constitution to further strengthen party leadership, making the Supreme Soviet's functions more focused on implementing party policies rather than independent legislation.\n\nWill the Supreme Soviet become a true legislative body, or will it ultimately become a tool for party execution? It all depends on the future."
